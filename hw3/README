Notes:
Make sure there's an output folder called 'out' in the directory. Nothing will work if this
folder does not exist. The dataset for 5 and 6 should be in 'data/(whatever_dataset)' in the 
path from wherever you run the code.

Problem 2:
Running

  python p2.py

should be sufficient. Outputs are in the folder 'out'.

Problem 3:
Running

  python p3.py

should be sufficient. Outputs are in the folder 'out'.

Problem 5:
Running

  python p5.py

should give some of the expected outputs in the folder 'out'.
Unfortunately I did not document this file very well so I am unsure whether or not all
the subparts are adequately outputted, but it should be close. Please email me at
  
  ys@berkeley.edu

for any confusion. Make sure your computer has the Pandas package installed.

Problem 6:
Running

  python p6.py

should be sufficient. Outputs are in the folder 'out'.
